"""Recorded-bus replay smoke tests for NCE.

NCE is request/response -- every ``out`` frame from us is paired
with an ``in`` reply from the command station. The replay pattern:

1. Read the capture.
2. For each ``out`` frame, verify the traffic controller emits
   exactly those bytes when we resend that command via the codec.
3. For each ``in`` frame, feed it into the port as the CS's reply
   so the pending ``send_command`` future resolves. Assert the
   decoded ``NceReply`` matches expectations.

Shared format lives in :mod:`pmri_core.testing.bus_replay` -- the
same JSONL used by :mod:`pmri_loconet.tests.integration.test_bus_replay`.
