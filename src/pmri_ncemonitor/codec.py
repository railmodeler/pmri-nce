"""NCE Cab Bus framing -- read 9-bit-marker framed messages.

The Cab Bus is a polled RS-485 bus operating at 9600 baud where the
command station addresses each cab in turn. Production hardware uses
9-bit serial; some USB-serial adapters can't deliver the 9th bit, so
both JMRI and we use a "high bit set = address byte" wire convention
when reading from such adapters. We adopt the same convention here:

* If ``byte & 0x80 != 0`` -> this byte is the *address* and starts a new
  message frame. The low 7 bits are the cab ID (or master ID).
* All following bytes (up to a per-address length) are 7-bit data.

This module is byte-stream level only; the message-level decoding lives
in :mod:`pmri_ncemonitor.messages`.
